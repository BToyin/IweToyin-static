              So, let me just get into my first blog post. As you can tell from the title, this post is about being one of the “mandem” at uni. For anyone not well versed in the ways of slang, “mandem” is essentially the equivalent of being one of the “boys” or the “lads” but in the context “ends”. Before we start, I have to put a disclaimer, and anyone that knows me can attest to this, I do not think I'm bad. I'm not a big man (literally I'm only 5'6) nor am I on any kind of crud (take part in any illegal activities) and I will call the police if your try to rob me However, I did spend my secondary and college years growing up and attending a pretty rough high school and living in the sort of area where you don't leave your house after 9pm.

              So, now that I've got some of the context out of the way I'll get into the actual crux of this post. Having chosen to attend University in Bath, I knew that I would be putting myself into a completely new environment, not just in terms of the University environment, but also because I knew that Bath is generally the sort of Uni to be attended by the white middle class. So, I went to Uni knowing that the way I talk, the words I use, my mannerisms and all of that good shit could, and probably would, be foreign to a lot of people. Similarly, to basically any 18/19-year-old going into Uni, I had a choice to make about whether I wanted to "fit in", thereby changing or dialing down the way I spoke or whether I would go in there and say yolo and start shooting off “wagwarns”, “safe” and “my G” to everyone. I went with the former because I thought it was way easier to try and fit in and adapt the way I speak rather than making myself stand out and potentially marginalizing myself. I had also perfected my “white people” voice at that point, so I didn't really find this too difficult.

              I think it's a pretty normal thing to do because, like any other 1st year, I wanted to make friends and make a good impression. On some level, I think I probably didn't want anyone to think I was less intelligent than they were based on the way I behaved and the words I chose to use. So, when I first got to Uni, it was all “cheers” (which has now become the legit way I say thanks to bus drivers) and “mate” like it was nothing and even snuck in a few “buddies” and “dudes”. I only really realized how much I had changed after going back to Birmingham during Christmas in first year. As soon as I was on the bus home from the train station I felt the energy within me change. Hopped off the bus with a quick “safe” to the bus driver as opposed to the “cheers” I had gotten so used to. After realizing I'd been toning down on my usual manner of speaking at Uni, and after spending a couple weeks surrounded by the gang and feeling like one of the mandem again, I made the conscious decision to be more myself at uni.

              With a renewed sense of self, I returned to Bath ready to be my best self. It really didn't last long. I fell back into using my white people voice almost as soon as I breathed the fresh Bath air. That isn't to say I didn't try though. I remember having a conversation on Facebook with a friend and after they'd said something, I replied with 'skeen' clearly forgetting that it was 2016 and who I was talking to. Even though this particular person was from London, and I assumed they'd know similar slang, they replied with "??". There's nothing more awkward than explaining to someone what a certain slang term means because most of the time, the slang term doesn’t have any business meaning what it does. On another occasion, with some course mates, I used the phrase “don't get it twisted”. The context made it pretty easy to grasp what the phrase meant, but I definitely got the sense that none of them had ever heard the phrase before. One of the guys turned to me and laughed while repeating the phrase to me, clearly amused. I'm not dense so I knew what was going on and couldn't really blame them. Nonetheless, it's one of those things that I think weighs on you subconsciously. This was around the time I stopped trying to force it. I fell into a weird situation where I felt like I was one person at Uni and another person back home.

              For the rest of first year I struggled with this sort of bite-sized identity crisis. To be honest, it's an odd situation to be in and I'm not really sure how I got over it. I think it was coming back to Uni for my 2nd year and moving into a smaller house with fewer people. Or it could've been me realizing that maybe I'm no one special and that everyone goes through similar things, as I discovered by chatting to the mandem during the summer. I guess it's different for everyone, but I think it's generally just getting more comfortable in the space that you're in. Being “yourself” doesn’t really mean anything because who’s to say who the “real” you is? At the end of the day, similar things happen to everyone going to uni and you gotta just take time. I'm going to end this post on that note, it was just a thought I had.
